**TODO: FIX THIS PART**
Fine individiual tree crown delineation can be achieved from RGB + NIR orthophotos using only CNN-based semantic segmentation with U-Net using weighted losses and simple morphological processing.

# Introduction


# Methods
## Study site and data acquisition
Aerial orthophotos of five neighborhoods in Berlin, Germany
